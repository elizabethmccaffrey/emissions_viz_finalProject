    <h3 class="oxygen-light"><i>A Global Analysis of Country Specific Green House Gas Emissions</i></h3>

    <p>The presence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere is the primary culprit of generating the
      phenomenon known as climate change.
      Each year, globally, emissions of GHGs have been steadily increasing and furthering the drastic effects of climate
      change on the planet. </p>

    <p>GHGs are naturally generated and make up a layer of the Earth's atmosphere, retaining thermal radiation. The
      primary GHGs consist of carbon dioxide (CO2),
      methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons). However, with the
      increase in human industry, such as farming
      and mass transport, the quantity of these gases has increased in the atmosphere. This increase in quantity
      generates
      greater heating effects furthering climate change.
      The GHG effect has numerous climate impacts, including rising sea levels, glacial thawing, and species extinction
      and/or migration; making the issue vital to observe and amend. </p>

    <p>In these data visualizations I hope to examine country specific greenhouse gas emissions overtime, as well as
      emission quantity breakdown by gas types. Additionally, each country’s GDP will also be considered in order to
      draw connections between emission quantity and a country's economy. Finally, each country’s emissions per capita (emissions /
      population) overtime will be observed in order to see how it compares to a country’s total emissions. </p>


    <h3 class="oxygen-regular">Data Introduction</h3>

    <p>The primary dataset that I am utilizing is from the European Commission, <i>EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global
      Atmospheric Research</i>. From the database I am using the EDGAR GHG emissions dataset. This dataset categorizes the
      data by and year (1970 - 2022). For each year, the dataset provides the total GHG emissions for each country. In
      addition, the data set also categorizes by substance (type of GHG emitted) and sector (industry generating GHGs).
      This creates a fine-grained data set as the emission level for each type of GHG can be identified, as well as the
      level at which sectors are emitting these gases. In addition, I will also be using <i>The World Bank</i> datasets to gather
      country
      specific data of yearly gross domestic product (GDP) and population.</p>


    <p>From each data set each country has year data ranging from 1970 - 2022 so every country has 52 GHG emission
      (separated by sector [agriculture, buildings, fuel exploitation, industrial combustion, power industry, processes,
      transport, waste], and gas type [C02, CH4, N20, F-gases]), GDP, and population data points. There are 209
      countries
      represented from which I will be selecting approximately 40 providing a wide range of data points and potential
      comparisons to see trends through the analysis.</p>

    <p>
      To Introduce the data, we present the selected countries emissions geographically. In the animation each circle
      visually represents the total emissions from the given country. The larger the circle the greater the countries
      emissions. Additionally, color is used to show emission severity with green being low and red being high severity.
      From the animation it can be seen that overtime
      almost all countries emissions have increased or increased significantly. The primary examples of this is China's
      change in emissions, starting off as a lower producer but eventually becoming the world's top producer by a large
      margin. </p>

    <h2 class="oxygen-regular">Visualizations</h2>

      </div>

      <p>We first present an overview of total greenhouse gas emissions overtime (1970 - 2022) by country. The goal of
        this
        visualization is to display the emission trends for each country and also compare emission quantity across
        countries. We can see that both China and the United States are the worlds top greenhouse gas producers. This is
        most likely due to both countries high levels of industry and mass production. Comparatively most other
        countries
        fall within mid-range emissions levels as most of the graph is clustered near the center, and produce
        significantly
        less emissions than the world top producers (as the scale on the y-axis is logarithmic). Interestingly we can
        see
        that Greenland has a high spike in emission production in 2003, while most other countries have a more gradual
        increase.</p>

      </div>


      <p>In addition to viewing a country's total emissions we can also see the emission breakdown by type of gas (ie.
        CO2, CH4, N2O, and F-Gases). In these stacked bar charts, we highlight each distinct gas with a color and
        separate
        out the emissions by sector. Here we can also draw a comparison between two selected countries. In these charts
        we
        specifically observe the year 2022. It is interesting to view how countries emission distribution differ by
        sector
        and
        type. Overall, the most prevalent gas produced is CO2. The most uncommon gas is the F-Gases, almost exclusively
        produced within the Processes sector.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we can also see the large difference in production between the world's top producing countries and
        the rest of the world. We can see that China has extreme CO2 emissions within the Power and Industrial
        Combustion
        industries. While the United States splits between the Power Industry and Transport. These graphs also identify
        industries which are critical to each country and how they allocate their resources. The isolated graphs exist
        for
        this purpose, as comparing China or the United States to a low producing country would create a negligible
        comparison. </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>In order to see how a country's economy impacts it total emissions here we use a scatter plot to identify a
          correlation between total emissions and total GDP per year. Instead of by country we perform an aggregate of
          each
          continent. In this plot we can generally see that an increase in GDP has a correlation with an increase in
          total
          emissions. This seems plausible as when a country's economic value increases, they would have more money to
          invest
          in industry, which produces many GHGs. Interestingly Europe has had a decline in emissions as GDP has
          increased,
          which could signify more regulations and reduction in emissions overtime while wealth has continued to
          grow.

      </div>


      <p>Another interesting area to observe for a country's emissions trends is to view emissions per capita overtime.
        Instead of just using total emissions, emissions per capita depends on the population of the country.
        This metric allows for an approximate idea of how many emissions each person generates within the country. This
        can have a
        much
        different trend then total emissions.</p>

      <p>In this graph we compare two countries at once viewing both the
        emissions per capita overtime and total emissions overtime to compare within the country and to another country.
        We can identify some interesting trends, such as a country with high total emissions, such as China, can
        comparatively have a low emissions per capita. This is usually the case within high population countries, as the
        emissions can be distrbuted amoungst a larger population. As such the
        emissions per individual is not as much as a high emission and low population country.
      </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>This visualization also looks at emissions per capita, but specifically in the year 2022. Here we compare all
          the
          selected countries and can sort by different characteristics, such as emissions per capita, population, and
          total
          emissions. The world's top ten producers are highlighted in red in order to see how they fall in the different
          sorts. We can clearly see here the difference between total emissions and emissions per capita. As Qatar has
          the
          highest emissions per capita, but when sorting by total emissions the US and China move to the front leaving
          Qatar
          towards the back. This means that Qatar produces a lot of GHGs compared to its population. </p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="oxygen-regular">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>From this visualization analysis, we can clearly see that greenhouse gas emissions are rising significantly
        over
        time. Additionally, the world's top producing countries are contributing to emissions significantly more than
        the rest of
        the
        world.
        From these observations it is evident we should make efforts to reduce our emissions, in order to prevent the
        irreversible
        damage
        of climate change on the planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        For further research into this topic, it would be interesting look more closely at GHG production within a
        specific country. For example, looking into regional differences in a singular country and identifying the
        higher
        vs. lower producing areas. In addition, we could look more specifically at the emissions distribution across
        social classes. For example, do citizens in higher income brackets typically generate greater emissions, and
        where do they live within the country?
